## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm sky blue (#77B5FE) to evoke feelings of openness and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), near white, creating a clean, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#E0A96F) for highlighting important info, provides contrast with sky blue, and suggests a connection to earth or local destinations.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and short, important blocks of text. 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer, smaller blocks of text. 'Poppins' offers geometric style, for an avant-garde feeling.
- Use location-based icons (e.g., map markers, landmarks) in a minimalist style, consistent with the font.
- Use a card-based layout to present information clearly, with enough whitespace to create a relaxed feel.
- Subtle, map-based animations to draw users' attention. Loading screens should have location hints related to the users geographical region.
